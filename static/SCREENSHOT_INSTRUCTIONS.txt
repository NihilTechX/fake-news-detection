# Screenshot Instructions

To enhance your GitHub repository, take screenshots of your application and save them here:

1. Take a screenshot of the web interface showing the input form and save as `interface.png`
2. Take a screenshot of the result after analyzing a news article and save as `result.png`
3. Take a general screenshot of the application for the preview image and save as `preview.png`

After taking these screenshots, update the paths in README_GITHUB.md if necessary, and rename it to README.md before pushing to GitHub.
